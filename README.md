# nodecord
## NOT YET FUNCTIONAL: Very WIP
A module written using NodeJS for creating a discord bot. Uses snodesocket for the websockets.

There is a few of these already out there, but I built this as my introduction to programming from an API.
It is also a good sister project with my WebSocket module snodesocket.
