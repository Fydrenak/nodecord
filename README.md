A lightweight for the Discord API for creating Discord bots with node.js.

There is a few of these already out there, but the aim of this is to be as lightweight as possible.
It is also a good sister project with my WebSocket module nocket.

_There **may or may not** be a bot token in the commit history. I don't know how I managed to miss that one. Of course, that token has been reset._
