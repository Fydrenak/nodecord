# nodecord
A wrapper for the Discord API for creating Discord bots.

There is a few of these already out there, but I built this as my introduction to programming from an API.
It is also a good sister project with my WebSocket module snodesocket.

_There **may or may not** be a bot token in the commit history. I don't know how I managed to miss that one. Of course, that token has been reset._
